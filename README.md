How to run command lines from Katalon
=====================================

This is a [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/) project for demonstration purpose.
You can clone this out on your PC and execute it with your Katalon Studio.

This project is meant to propse a solution for the following discussion:
https://forum.katalon.com/discussion/6675/how-to-run-command-lines-from-katalon

The test case TC1 shows how to use java.lang.ProcessBuilder and

Well, this is about Java programming, not about Katalon Studio.
